# Preppin-Data-Challenge----Customer-Classifications

using PYTHON and SQL to complete the Preppin' Data Challenge -- Customer Classifications

This challenge is from Tableau weekly Preppin' Data blog.

The full original data and requirements for data cleaning and prepping can be found: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2022/03/2022-week-9-customer-classifications.html

Two coding languages, i.e., Python and SQL, are used to complete the challenge, respectively.

For python, I generated two Excel files. 
One is 'Output_Required.xlsx', which is the required output file in the challenge. 
The othe one is 'Output_forTableau.xlsx', which removes the unnecessary rows AND columns in 'Output_Required.xlsx' and is used in Tableau for Customer Classifications
